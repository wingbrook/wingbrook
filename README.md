Hello everyone, my name is Wing Brook and I am a coding rookie trying to wrap my head around PHP and WordPress. I do have a background of the big three, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I’m a 2nd-year student and also own a website dedicated to all things x _ x _ x _ x _ x _ x _ x _x.

This GitHub is where I'll be posting my work, the mistakes  I’ve made and the things I’ve learned during the process of learning. You can follow me, give  me some tips or just see what I’m up to!

-🥦👨‍💻 Fun fact: I’m still perfecting my x _ x _ x _ x _ x _ x _ x _ recipes!

I own a website with that worships broccoli. All kinds of broccoli and anything broccoli. If you want to learn more about me or check out my projects, feel free to visit https://simplybroccoli.netlify.app/
